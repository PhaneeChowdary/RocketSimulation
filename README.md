# 🚀 Phanee Rocket Landing Simulation

Hey there! Welcome to my fun rocket landing simulator! Ever wondered what it's like to land a rocket vertically? Well, now you can try it yourself! This is a fun project I built to simulate the amazing feat of landing a rocket - just like those cool SpaceX landings we see, but with my own twist. 😎

## ✨ What's Cool About It?

- 🎮 Real-time controls - Be the pilot!
- 🌪️ Wind effects - Because landing in perfect conditions is too easy
- 🔥 Cool rocket flames that react to your controls
- 🎥 Multiple camera angles to watch your landing
- 🦿 Deployable landing legs and grid fins
- 📊 Live data to track your landing precision

## 🎯 How to Play

1. Clone this fun project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/phanee-rocket-sim.git
cd phanee-rocket-sim
```

2. Get it running
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

3. Land that rocket! 
- Hit the Launch button 🚀
- Wait for it to reach hover altitude ⬆️
- Click Begin Landing and try to land smoothly! 🎯
- Don't crash! (but if you do, that's part of the fun 💥)

## 🛠️ Built With

- React (because it's awesome)
- SVG Graphics (for those smooth visuals)
- A bunch of physics calculations (to make it feel real)
- Love for rockets! ❤️

## 🎮 Pro Tips

- Keep an eye on your velocity - landing too fast isn't great for the rocket!
- Watch out for wind effects
- Use the different camera views to nail that perfect landing
- Practice makes perfect!
